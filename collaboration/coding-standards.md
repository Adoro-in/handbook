# Coding Standards

The goal of writing code is to create a seamless integration between developers' work that leads to easily understandable conventions, logical flows, and a highly maintainable codebase. The unique qualities you, as a developer, bring to the project are not expressed as coding idioms or fancy tricks â€“ we do not strive to win an obfuscated or fancy-pants coding contest. We strive to make code that can be immediately understood by our colleagues whenever something needs to be picked up for further work at a later time and place.

In general, there are a few guiding styles that represent best practices of writing code and you should generally adhere very closely to them. Where there is no immediate information about our customization of the style guide, refer to the published specifications referenced below. At worst, this will spark a conversation among the team to consider (or re-consider) a current practice. But generally if we have not defined an override for a stylistic element, then you are best served to stick with the common convention and industry-standard best practice.

## Python Coding Standards

[** Know and Love PEP-8 **](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
The most important thing for you to know as you write Python code is the importance of PEP-8:

Read the full PEP-8 document before going any further in to the code.
