# Creating Github Pull Requests

In order to work effectively with git and github, you must understand the philosophy of itâ€™s development mode. Git was created by Linus Torvalds to solve the code management issues experienced by the Linux kernel team. This team is highly distributed, highly capable, and very large, so the design requirements for git were to be very fast, very flexible, and to work well with a distributed team.

GitHub adds to the core of git a web interface that makes it easy to browse code, create repository forks, and assign permissions. This combination is extremely powerful when used effectively. In order to work effectively in this model, you must be able to create independent changes to your code and submit them as a functional changeset.
